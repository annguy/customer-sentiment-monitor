## Abstract

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
### Clone
Clone this repo to your local machine 
### Setup
Create environment using the requirements.txt
```
# using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# using Conda
conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
```
Activate environment
```
conda activate customer_sentiment_monitor 
```
Install src in the new environment 
```
pip install -e.
```

Register a notebook kernel
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=customer_sentiment_monitor
```

### Data
You can download the data via Zenodo [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4383145). Please put the files ```feature_matrix_LSTM.pickl``` and ```feature_matrix.pickle``` into the folder ```data/raw/``` in order to run the provided ```main.py```. 

### Run
**1.** To set the configurations, use the config.ini. The model_name, late_fusion_flag and feature_type from config.ini can be used to conduct the experiements. The rest of the configurations are exactly the same as in the paper.<br>
**2.** To run the weekly analysis, use the command below
```
python main.py
```
After each week the results are saved in data/interim/. If you want to continue training, use cont_week from config.ini.<br>
**3.** To visualize and evaluate data/results/results.pickle from weekly analysis, notebooks/Visualization.ipynb can be used.
The pdfs from visualization will be saved in data/visualizations/
